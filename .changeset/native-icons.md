Icons are now fully native and the app's own: `plugins: [['@hzblj/kara-ui', {icons: {source: './assets/icons'}}]]` turns every SVG in the folder into an iOS asset-catalog template image and an Android vector drawable at prebuild (`x.ios.svg` / `x.android.svg` for per-platform glyphs), and writes `kara-icons.d.ts` so `name` only accepts icons that exist; `npx kara-icons` does the same for CI. `Icon` draws them in a host, the new `RnIcon` anywhere, and `Tabs` passes them as `xcasset` / `drawable`. The built-in SF Symbol / Material icon names and the `@expo/vector-icons` peer dependency are gone.
