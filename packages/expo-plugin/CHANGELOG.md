### Minor Changes

- [#31](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/pull/31) [`4b20462`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/4b204621670b6f640fc04bffa527007dda9e06a8) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - Icons and the zoom transition now come from two standalone packages, which work without kara too.

  - **Icons: [@hzblj/expo-native-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hzblj/expo-native-icons).** The config plugin is the same (`plugins: [['@hzblj/kara-ui', {icons: {source: './assets/icons'}}]]`, the same options, `npx kara-icons` still works). The names change: the declaration is now `native-icons.d.ts` with the global `NativeIcons` (it was `kara-icons.d.ts` and `KaraIcons`), and each icon is `native_icon_<name>` natively (it was `kara_icon_<name>`). Delete the old `kara-icons.d.ts`, and run `expo prebuild --clean` once so the old assets go. `RnIcon` is now the package's `NativeIcon`: on Android it draws the drawable itself instead of hosting an `ImageView`, and remembers each icon's resource lookup, so a list of rows does less work. A glyph with a non-square viewBox no longer stretches on Android.
  - **Zoom transition: [@hzblj/expo-zoom-transition](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hzblj/expo-zoom-transition).** `ZoomTransition` and its helpers from `@hzblj/kara-ui/router` are unchanged: kara's tokens over the package. The native code moved out of `@hzblj/kara-native` into the package's own module, which `@hzblj/kara-native` depends on, so autolinking picks it up. A tapped context menu preview still zooms. Rebuild the native app.
  - `iconResourceName` moved from `@hzblj/kara-native` to `@hzblj/expo-native-icons`, and `@hzblj/kara-expo-plugin` no longer exports the icon generator or `./cli`: import them from `@hzblj/expo-native-icons/plugin` and `@hzblj/expo-native-icons/cli`.

### Patch Changes

- [`6e7903a`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/6e7903afa3d3442e04a48a6e24399f9f03559a03) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - `npx kara-icons ./assets/icons` works without `--out`; it used to skip the folder and print its usage.

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`be5be81`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/be5be81a3764dfbd199c3c3cf90deadc6e53d268) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - Installable again: 0.2.0 was published with `workspace:^` ranges between the kara packages, which no package manager outside this repository resolves. The packages now go out through Yarn, which writes the real version ranges.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c30bef6`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/c30bef6be2639deb6d385ad209d1a2799b5b656f) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - Icons are now fully native and the app's own: `plugins: [['@hzblj/kara-ui', {icons: {source: './assets/icons'}}]]` turns every SVG in the folder into an iOS asset-catalog template image and an Android vector drawable at prebuild (`x.ios.svg` / `x.android.svg` for per-platform glyphs), and writes `kara-icons.d.ts` so `name` only accepts icons that exist; `npx kara-icons` does the same for CI. `Icon` draws them in a host, the new `RnIcon` anywhere, and `Tabs` passes them as `xcasset` / `drawable`. The built-in SF Symbol / Material icon names and the `@expo/vector-icons` peer dependency are gone.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`f919c7b`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/f919c7b06f3798cebd58eef1581076bf1ee61cd1) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - First release of the kara-ui design system: theme and tokens, the `sx` engine, atoms, molecules, organisms and `Screen`, native tabs (`@hzblj/kara-ui/router`), the KaraUI native module (Liquid Glass, scroll edge effect, native countdown, context menu with preview, rich tooltip, FAB menu), and `KaraProvider` with theme overrides (colours, the app's own fonts, the Material seed, and Material You dynamic colour on Android). Text uses the platform's face by default. Install `@hzblj/kara-ui`; the scoped packages are its building blocks.
