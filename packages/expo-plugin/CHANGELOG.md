### Patch Changes

- [`6e7903a`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/6e7903afa3d3442e04a48a6e24399f9f03559a03) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - `npx kara-icons ./assets/icons` works without `--out`; it used to skip the folder and print its usage.

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`be5be81`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/be5be81a3764dfbd199c3c3cf90deadc6e53d268) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - Installable again: 0.2.0 was published with `workspace:^` ranges between the kara packages, which no package manager outside this repository resolves. The packages now go out through Yarn, which writes the real version ranges.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c30bef6`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/c30bef6be2639deb6d385ad209d1a2799b5b656f) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - Icons are now fully native and the app's own: `plugins: [['@hzblj/kara-ui', {icons: {source: './assets/icons'}}]]` turns every SVG in the folder into an iOS asset-catalog template image and an Android vector drawable at prebuild (`x.ios.svg` / `x.android.svg` for per-platform glyphs), and writes `kara-icons.d.ts` so `name` only accepts icons that exist; `npx kara-icons` does the same for CI. `Icon` draws them in a host, the new `RnIcon` anywhere, and `Tabs` passes them as `xcasset` / `drawable`. The built-in SF Symbol / Material icon names and the `@expo/vector-icons` peer dependency are gone.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`f919c7b`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/f919c7b06f3798cebd58eef1581076bf1ee61cd1) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - First release of the kara-ui design system: theme and tokens, the `sx` engine, atoms, molecules, organisms and `Screen`, native tabs (`@hzblj/kara-ui/router`), the KaraUI native module (Liquid Glass, scroll edge effect, native countdown, context menu with preview, rich tooltip, FAB menu), and `KaraProvider` with theme overrides (colours, the app's own fonts, the Material seed, and Material You dynamic colour on Android). Text uses the platform's face by default. Install `@hzblj/kara-ui`; the scoped packages are its building blocks.
