### Minor Changes

- [#17](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/pull/17) [`4c7eaa0`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/4c7eaa021ee4a4b0475e1dfb420fa5803c21ba29) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - Android gets glass and a scroll edge of its own.

  - `GlassView` is frosted glass on Android: what lies behind the capsule, blurred (Android 12+), under a translucent tonal surface (or its `tint`) and a light hairline, the blurred surfaces Android 16 gives its own system UI. It was an almost clear capsule that left its content unreadable over a photo. Below Android 12 the same colours are drawn near-opaque. kara-native's new `BackdropBlurView` (`/jetpack-compose`) does the blur (blurred, then saturated, as iOS lifts the colour under its materials): a plain view, no host, and an idle screen draws no frames.
  - `ScrollEdgeContainer` on Android behaves like a Material top app bar on scroll: the bars stay transparent at rest and fill with the scrolled container colour once content scrolls under the top one, the bottom one while there is more below. Its scroll view also takes the room between the bars now; before, it grew to its content's height, ran under the bottom bar and could not scroll.
  - New token `surface.secondary`, a step above `surface.primary`: Material's `surfaceContainer` on Android, `tertiarySystemGroupedBackgroundColor` on iOS.

### Minor Changes

- [#8](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/pull/8) [`3b0a6fb`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/3b0a6fbc49559720023fece2b5c6189ad4d88bc8) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - `ZoomTransition`: a push that grows out of the photo it was opened from and shrinks back into it.

  - iOS 18: UIKit's zoom transition, with the interactive dismissal (swipe down, edge swipe, pinch) gated on the scroll views under the finger. Below iOS 18 the push stays a slide. Android: Material's container transform, both ways.
  - Three pieces from `@hzblj/kara-ui/router`, tied by one identifier: `ZoomTransition.Source` on the list, `ZoomTransition.Enabler` and `ZoomTransition.Target` on the pushed screen; `useZoomTransitionSourceId`, `ZOOM_TRANSITION_PARAM`, `useZoomTransitionParam` and `withZoomTransition` (an Android fade under the transform) around them.
  - Settings both platforms honour sit at the top (`scrim`); the rest is typed apart under `ios` (`dismissGesture`, `blur`, the target's `fit`) and `android` (`duration`, `easing`, `fade`, `path`, corner radii, the target's `fit` and `flex`).
  - `ContextMenu`: with a `ZoomTransition.Source` in the trigger, a tap on the iOS preview zooms the preview's photo straight into the pushed screen. `previewTransition` (`zoom`, `pop`, `dismiss`) picks how the preview leaves.
  - `DurationSize`, the keys of `duration`.

### Patch Changes

- [`be5be81`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/be5be81a3764dfbd199c3c3cf90deadc6e53d268) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - Installable again: 0.2.0 was published with `workspace:^` ranges between the kara packages, which no package manager outside this repository resolves. The packages now go out through Yarn, which writes the real version ranges.

- [`f919c7b`](https://github.com/hzblj/kara-ui/commit/f919c7b06f3798cebd58eef1581076bf1ee61cd1) Thanks [@hzblj](https://github.com/hzblj)! - First release of the kara-ui design system: theme and tokens, the `sx` engine, atoms, molecules, organisms and `Screen`, native tabs (`@hzblj/kara-ui/router`), the KaraUI native module (Liquid Glass, scroll edge effect, native countdown, context menu with preview, rich tooltip, FAB menu), and `KaraProvider` with theme overrides (colours, the app's own fonts, the Material seed, and Material You dynamic colour on Android). Text uses the platform's face by default. Install `@hzblj/kara-ui`; the scoped packages are its building blocks.
